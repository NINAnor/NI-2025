# The Norwegian Nature Index 2025

This repository contains code and documentation used in the 2025 update of the Norwegian Nature Index (NI).

The work encompasses the following parts: 

- Update of indicator data calculation in the Nature Index database
- Visualization of original and scaled indicator data
- Calculations of the NI for all seven main ecosystems: forest ("skog"), mountain ("fjell"), wetland ("våtmark"), open grassland ("åpent lavland"), freshwater ("ferskvann", including requested thematic indices), coast ("kyst"), and marine pelagic ("hav").
-  Visualizations of calculated NI (maps, time-series, and auxiliary plots)

The data underlying this work are stored in the NI database (https://naturindeks.nina.no/) and have been delivered by species and data management experts from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), the Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO), the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research (HI), and BirdLife Norway. 

Calculations and analyzes are done using the NIcalc (https://github.com/NINAnor/NIcalc) and NIflex (https://github.com/NINAnor/NIflex) R pacakges.
Some visualizations are built based on code from NIviz (https://github.com/NINAnor/NIviz). 

All materials in this repository, as well as the NI database, will be made publicly accessible when NI2025 is officially launched in November 2025. 
Any inquiries about the materials can be sent to naturindeks@nina.no.
